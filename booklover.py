class BookLover:
    '''
    A BookLover represents a person with a name, an email address, a favorite genre, a number of read-books, and a read-book list
    who can add a read book, return a number of indicator of whether this BookLover has read a book, return a number of read books, and return a list of favorite books.

    Instance variables:

            a data frame with columns labeled 'book_name' and 'book_rating' containing read books (i.e., titles of books this BookLover has read and
            this BookLover's ratings of those books on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 means this BookLover did not like the book at all, and 5 means this BookLover loved the book)
