class BookLover:
    '''
    A BookLover represents a person with a name, an email address, a favorite genre, a number of read-books, and a read-book list
    who can add a read book, return a number of indicator of whether this BookLover has read a book, return a number of read books, and return a list of favorite books.

    Instance variables:
